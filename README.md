# Compilation of Growth Data collected from the Owl Limpet Population at Cabrillo National Monument San Diego, California Beginning September 2023

This repository includes data, analysis, and methods for Chapter 1 of my Master's thesis at California State University, Northridge

**Authors:** Cindy Fajardo*, Nyssa J Silbiger

**Funding:** Funding for this project was provided by California State University, Northridge Department of Biology, Sigma Xi Grants-in-Aid of Research, and NSF BIO-OCE # to NJS.

**Contents:** There are 3 folders and this ReadMe file. The folders are Data, Output and Script which are listed below:
1. Data: All .csv files that are needed to run the scripts
2. Script: All RMarkdown and HTML scripts that help visualize the data and scripts that analyze the data that was collected
3. Output: All graphs that are created through the RMarkdown files

This is a live repository. I am continually adding new information as I continue to collect growth data over the seasons in the next year.
